# Microblogging - a Laravel project using Docker

By Alpha Bah, Helder Ferreira Marie Koscianski-Ducharlet and Gabriel Parizet during a two-week sprint at [Ada Tech School](https://adatechschool.fr/)

## Project overview

This project aimed to create a microblogging platform using the PHP framework Laravel. We also were strongly encouraged to set up a Docker environment to develop it.

## Challenges

All four of us had zero prior knowledge of both Laravel and Docker. Our first challenge was get Docker up and running on all four machines (one Windows 11, two Windows 10, one MacBook).

We then followed the Laravel Bootcamp and implemented our "Chirps" platform using Blade for the GUI!
